# Homework
1. HelloWorld API extention: Update API request interface
- Notice your lambda function looks up four attributes from the api call: `name`, `city`, `day` and `time`. Try to update your API so that:
    - the API expects all four attributes passed in from API call body, and not query parameter or header.
    - only `name` and `city` is required from API call. When any of these two are not provided, the API should return error message indicating the correct API call parameters.
    - when `day` and `time` are not provided from API call, dynamically lookup day and time from code (use AEST timezone) and use the result in the response

2.  HelloWorld API extention: Support data read and write in your API
- Rename the exsiting `/helloworld` resource to `/register` resource, and support following when the API gets a PUT request on `/register`:
    - the API expects two required body attribute `name` and `city`, and put a unique record in dynamodb. (might need to introduce a primary key `ID` and generate this uniquely via code)
    - when the incoming request does not supply any of the required attribute, the API should return error message indicating the correct API call parameters.
- Create a new resource `/lookup` in the API, and support following when the API gets a GET request on `/lookup`:
    - the API expects one required body attribute `name`, and return all matched records (case insensitive) from dynamodb that matches the input name.

3. HelloWorld API extention: Deploy your API using SAM

You have been using AWS console to create and update your API Gateway and Lambda function.

It's time to start using AWS SAM to build and deploy the API.
Ref: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-getting-started-hello-world.html

Consider following:
- use `sam local invoke` to test your function during development
