# Regex practice

## Practice 1

Revise the following regular expression operators:

`()[]{}.*+?^$|\`

For each of the following, give a couple of examples of strings which the regular expression would match. Describe (colloquially, in a manner that a non-technical person would understand) the set of strings that the pattern is designed to match.

- `/[a-zA-Z]+/`
- `/^[A-Za-z][a-z]*$/`
- `/p[aeiou]{0,2}t/`
- `/\s(\w+)\s\1/`
- `/^(\+[0-9][0-9]|0)[0-9] ([0-9][ -]?){8}$/`

## Practice 2

Write a regular expression to solve the following problems:

- Match a price
- Validate an email address
